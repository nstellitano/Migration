Design Studio Feedback

Group Partner: Michael (MIT)

Feedback 1: 
We should use legends and have a really good narrative for the story we want to tell with our visualization.

Comment: Both Michael and us were working with maps. He was working with transportation data from Massachusetts. We are working with the map of the world. And he thought it was more challenging to get the attributes for all countries correct, especially given that both our teams were trying to vary the map by more than one indicator. So, I think this feedback was helpful in making the visualization more compact.

For the narrative part, Michael advised us to use texts and brief paragraphs, either accompanying the maps in the layout or having them pop up as users click different features on the map. We will take that into consideration.

Feedback 2: 
Michael felt we had too many graphs in the same layout and he was struggling with the same problem.

Comment: The tradeoff here is telling a comprehensive story vs. having a compelling visual layout. We want to balance the two. We definitely do no want to cram everything together but we do want to say a coherent story given our hypothesis on migration. One optional feature we would like to have is a different layout (from our main layout), where we show animations because we have data that varies by time and we are not using it in our main feature.


Feedback 3:
Michael advised us to use pull information from different smaller json files as opposed to having one large json file.

Comment: The tradeoff here is between having several tractable json files and having one large file that could be used for multiple interactive graphs. Interactivity between several plots and the map is a must for the kind of stories we want to tell and we decided to have one large json file based on which we will create most of our layouts.
